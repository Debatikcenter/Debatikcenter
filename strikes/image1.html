<p>Armando Lulaj, <em>Pissed Off</em>, 2017</p>
<p>Shortly after work on Skanderbeg Square was completed in the summer of 2017, Armando Lulaj – attended by his friends and frequent collaborators Mr. Giovanni Dedonà and Mr. Pleurad Xhafa – carried out the following performance on the new square: Having positioned himself at the apex of the not-so-slight inclination of the new square, Lulaj unzipped the old, worn-out jeans he was wearing that morning, whipped his penis out of his shorts and took a piss. The piss was certainly a welcome relief after a long night of breaking stones. More to the point, while the inclination of the new square, or, rather, positioning oneself on top of it, is meant to make the individual feel empowered, the question remains as to what would this hypothetical empowered individual would actually do? Given the state of Albanian politics and government these days, he or she would most likely piss on the lot of them.</p></div>
