<p class="para" style="line-height:1.5em; padding-bottom:10px;">On Sunday May 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020, around 4 am, while the country was in lockdown due to
  COVID-19 pandemic measures, a large number of armed police erupted into the building
  of the National Theater of Albania. The police were wearing balaclavas on their faces,
  they had no identification numbers on their uniforms, and they were carrying machine
  guns. Inside the building were a small number of activists and artists, who had been
  occupying the theater for two years in a row with the intention of protecting it from
  demolition.
</p>
<p class="para" style="line-height:1.5em; padding-bottom:10px;">The government's plan to demolish the National Theater was executed in several stages,
  and through a series of illegal and unconstitutional acts that bore clear signs of state
  corruption. It began with the proposal of a ‘Special Law’ by a local oligarch, who offered
  to build a new and contemporary theater on the grounds of the existing National Theatre,
  ostensibly “for free”, in exchange for the transfer of the <em>public</em> land on which the
  National Theatre stood into his company’s <em>private</em> ownership, and permission to build a
  series of skyscrapers and shopping malls on that land. This new and contemporary theatre
  was supposed to be built by a ‘starchitect’ who is very close to PM Edi Rama. It would be
  an understatement to say that the land on which the National Theater once stood, which is
  right in the heart of the capital, is one of the most coveted pieces of real estate in Tirana.
  The government’s demolition plan was nothing more than a scheme to open up space for
  new constructions, which is the reason why many other historical buildings in Tirana
  have met a similar fate to the National Theatre. The primary function of this construction
  boom is, in turn, to launder the money of organized crime. That is why the protest for the
  protection of the National Theatre became something much bigger than the protection of
  a historical building, concerning also the concept of the commons, of democracy, the
  abuse of power, corruption and the incessant rise of fascism in the country. This is also
  why the protest had to be suppressed at all costs, because it was demonstrating day after
  day that in front of them, in front of us, there was not only the machinery of the state
  apparatus but also that of organized crime collaborating intensively with the state. For
  this government Art has always been the perfect cover. For this government Art should
  not criticize. Art should not protest.</p>
  <p class="para" style="line-height:1.5em; padding-bottom:10px;">The attack carried out on the National Theatre was indeed very violent. There are many
    videos which were shot by protesters outside of the building that show activists and
    artists being beaten, arrested, and injured. The video I chose is the last video to have been
    recorded inside the National Theatre. It is the result of a Facebook Live made by an
    activist just before the collapse. She was hiding in a corner of the lodges on the second
    floor, until the moment she was caught, forced to stop recording and escorted out by the
    police. Her courageous act made it possible for all of us to see the police violence inside
    the building but also (potentially) identify some of the officers involved.</p>
  <p class="para" style="line-height:1.5em; padding-bottom:10px;">In the original footage, both the image and the sound were of very low quality. In thevideo you see here, the sound has been developed in order to bring out as many ‘hidden’
    details and nuances as possible, which were impossible to grasp in the original footage. In
    order to develop the sound, I decided to work with a sound engineer in Italy who has
    extensive experience working with the courts in the context of criminal cases.
    Consequently, the video you see may be submitted as evidence in a court of law, evidence
    that can help determine the identities of the police officers involved in the brutal attack against democracy on May 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Today this has to be the power of art in Albania.
    Art should expose. Art should protest. (Armando Lulaj)</p>
